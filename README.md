# Project Overview 

- Set out to learn about **option pricing** and how financial options are valued.
- Gained a basic understanding of what an option is and how the **binomial model** is used to price options through step-by-step valuation over time.
- Implemented the **binomial option pricing model** in Python, calculating the price of European options.
- The implementation allows users to enter in parameters and be returned a call and put option price, as well as two heatmaps showing varying option prices at different volatilities and stock prices.
- Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit** to make the model more user-friendly and accessible.
- This project was heavily inspired by Coding Jesus' "Build this if you want to break into quant trading".
